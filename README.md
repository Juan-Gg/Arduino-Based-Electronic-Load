# Arduino-BAsed-Electronic-Load

This is the code that drives the electronic load described here: https://juangg-projects.blogspot.com/2019/02/arduino-based-electronic-load.html
It is in 3 separate files, just put all of them in the same folder and open one on the Arduino IDE. They will appear as tabs. Please refer to the link above for schematics and more information.
